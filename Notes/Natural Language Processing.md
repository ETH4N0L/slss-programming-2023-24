# Natural Language Processing
#### Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
WE use the `print()` function to display output

```python
	print("Your text goes here")
	```


# Headers 
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by python
This means that the text is ignored
We use the # symbol to make comments
